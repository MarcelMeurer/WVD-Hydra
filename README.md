## Terms
"Hydra" is a solution to manage Azure Virtual Desktop (Azure Virtual Desktop) for one or more tenants. It's a working solution and can be installed in any subscription. The solution can be used at your own risk and without the right of indemnity. However, I am trying to publish the preview releases in high quality.

The project is available as a **free community edition, even for commercial use** (up to 6 session hosts per host pool and a single tenant) and as a supported licensable product ($2 or â‚¬2 per concurrent user/month). Hydra will generally work without limitation for the first 30 days and switched to the community edition. Please reach out to extend the trial period or license your Hydra instance through the Azure Subscription ([Billing subscription to Hydra](https://portal.azure.com/#create/itprocloudgmbh1628775137215.hydra-pay-c1/preview)).

The owner of this solution is [ITProCloud GmbH](https://www.itprocloud.com/), [info@itprocloud.com](mailto:info@itprocloud.com).

Please make sure to send feedback and update the solution regularly.

## Installation

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/itprocloudgmbh1628775137215.hydra-deploy-d1hydra-free-d1" target="_blank"><img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton"/></a>

Use the "Deploy to Azure" button to roll out your instance of Hydra into your subscription.

<a href="https://youtu.be/GaRrotF0peM" target="_blank">See the installation and basic configuration on YouTube</a>


During the deployment, you have to enter the following information:

- Basics

  - Subscription
  - Resource group
  - Region
  - Name of your deployment: That name becomes the hostname of the hydra-portal e.g., "myhydrainstance.azurewebsites.net". The name must be unique for some resource types. Press "Tab" to let Azure check the availability of the name

- Service Principal for the web authentication

  - A (web) service principal is needed to let users log in to the hydra-portal website. Create the service principal with the PowerShell script in the Cloud Shell. Copy the following data into the fields: 
  - Application Id
  - The secret of the service principal and Confirm secret.

- Administration

  - Add the UPN of the master administrator into the field. You can add multiple administrators separated with a comma. These users have full access to the solution and can add other users with specific permissions in one of the following updates.

- Tags

  - Are optional to tag the resources

After that, click "Create" to install your instance of Project Hydra into your subscription. The deployment will take some minutes.

**Hint:** The service principal for the web authentication expires after two years and must be updated. Check out this post if you got the error message [AADSTS7000222:  InvalidClientSecretExpiredKeysProvided](webauthentication-update-secret.md)


## Cost saving for a small environment

If you are using Hydra in a small environment (a few pools with few hosts), you can reduce the cost of the app service running Hydra.
- Change the app service plan deployed with Hydra from S1 to B1
  - Scale up (App Sevice plan)
  - Dev Test -> B1


## Adding a tenant

***Note:** If you are not familiar with the first configuration and creating a service principal in Azure, write us a mail to give you free support: [info@itprocloud.com](mailto:info@itprocloud.com)*

Open your Project Hydra instance in a web browser by entering https://myhydrainstance.azurewebsites.net (myhydrainstance is the name of your deployment from the basic step).

Log in with the user you have entered in the administration step (Administrator(s) of the solution). Note: You can change this setting on the deployed app service -> Configuration -> Application settings -> "config:Administrators")

Click "Tenants" and "Add" to add your first or a new tenant. Next, you need a service principal to give Project Hydra access to the WVD resources in the tenant. A service principal is like a functional account that is used for the Hydra engine to log in and access the resources.



You can use **[WVDAdmin](https://blog.itprocloud.de/Windows-Virtual-Desktop-Admin/)** credentials if you have or create a new service principal:

- Open [https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps)

- Click "New registration"

  - Enter a name for the service principal, e.g., "svc-Hydra_Engine"
  - Click "Register"

- Click "Certificates & secrets"

  - Click "New client secret"
  - Select an expiration date, e.g., 18 month
  - Click "Add"
  - Directly copy the value (the secret) for later use

- Click "Overview"

  - Copy the following data to configure the service principal in Project Hydra

    - Directory (tenant) ID -> Tenant id
    - Application (client) ID -> Application id
    - The secret from the previous step -> Secret



Before you complete the configuration in Project Hydra, go to your Azure subscription and add the created service principal with contributor permissions to the subscription or all resource groups containing your WVD environment (VMs, host pools, images, v-net, ...). 



Go back to the configuration and give your new tenant configuration a display name and check "Enabled". You can test the service principal by clicking "Test primary". After that, click "Save". Please reload the website after a few minutes to see your environment in Project Hydra.



## Imaging and Rollout of new Hosts

### Capturing an image
Hydra can create an image from a Golden Master without destroying the master; therefore, Hydra first copies the VM to run the imaging process. Afterwards, the copy is deleted. In the end, you have an Image and the untouched master.

Note:
- A custom image can be created directly into a resource group if the golden master is not "trusted launch" enabled. The image can also be copied to an existing Compute Gallery definition.
- A trusted launch VM must be stored in  an existing Compute Gallery definition (the definition must be of the type "Trusted launch"

Go to: *Image Builder -> Create an image*
- Select the Golden Master from the virtual machine list
- Select the "Target Resource Group" of the image to be created
- Modify the other options if needed
- Trusted Launch: For trusted launch enabled Golden Master: Open "Azure Compute Gallery" and select the prepared Azure Compute Gallery Definition and the target location(s)

**Click on "Create Image"**

![](media/Capturing-Image-01.png)

The image process takes 6 to 45 minutes, depending on the size of the master, the targets (compute galleries), and the installed application. Please keep an eye on the log.


### Rollout Session Hosts
To roll out a session host, start creating a default rollout configuration at the host pool.

Go to: *Dashboard -> Bruger menu of the host pool -> New Session Host Rollout*

![](media/Roloutconfig-01.png)

Configure the parameters for deployments, like:
- Naming Schema (must end with several # to count up the computer names)
- Network and Subnet
- Image: Most important to rollout new hosts based on a custom image
- Resource Group of the VM
- VM size
- Etc.

Hovering over the fields pops up a description for each field.

**Don't forget to click on "Save"**

Go to the session host view: *Dashboard -> Click in the middle of a host pool -> Click on the "+" icon -> Enter the number of new hosts*:

![](media/Roloutconfig-02.png)


## Deployment, special operations

### Spot instances

[Spot instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/virtual-machines/spot) VMs are unused compute power in Azure available for a lower price. If Microsoft Azure needs the resources, it will deallocate the VM without a visible warning to the users. So, using spot instances in production is not recommended. It's good for testing and demonstrations.

If a session host is deployed with the option "Use Spot instance, if possible", the host is marked and will be created as a spot instance. If that fails, the host is created as a standard VM. The same happens for starting such a marked host: If possible, the host is started as a spot instance, and if it fails, as a normal VM. That ensures that even autoscaling tries to use the spot instance first, even if Azure revokes the resources before. Session hosts show the marking with an icon in the host list. The maker can be delted with a script collection task.


## Scaling

Scaling can be essential in a WVD environment regarding the costs. For example, running virtual machines costs money - independent if users are connected or not. Additionally, the storage costs 24/7 - even for a deallocated virtual machine. Typically in WVD, the number of user sessions changed from time to time, and in a best-case, the number of running session hosts correspondent to the actual count of user sessions.

Hydra can scale pooled session hosts (multi-session) and persistent (VDI) host pools in a very smart way - like an autopilot for host pools. And: It can create temporary session hosts on demand if needed and delete them later, saving costs for the non-existing virtual disks.



### Scaling of pooled host pools

A pooled host pool should have always had enough running session host to provide capacity to host the upcoming users (but not more) or should use Power-on-Connect to start the first session host while a user begins the connection.

While hydra autoscaling and autoshutdown works perfectly with Power-on-Connect, I recommend [enabling this feature](https://blog.itprocloud.de/Custom-Role-for-Power-On-Connect-Preview/). Additionally, Power-on-Connect allows deallocating all session hosts if no user is connected.



***Dashboard -> Three dots icon (configuration) on the host pool -> Autoscale & Autoshutdown***



Enable the configuration and configure the basic settings:

- Use Power-On-Connect (preview feature):
  Check this (and configure Power-on-Connect) to bring the host pool down to zero session hosts
- Session hosts running 24/7:
  With Power-on-Connect you can go down to 0. If you have reserved instanced, it is a good option to let some session hosts running permanently (users don't have to wait for the start of a session host)
- Default Loadbalancer Type:
  Should be "Depth-First"
- Min. number of available sessions:
  A minimum amount of a free session capacity. If you set it to 5 then always enough session hosts are available to host 5 more sessions. 0 is the most cost-saving value (brings the host pool down to zero session hosts)
- Min. number of hosts without sessions:
  A minimum amount of session hosts without user sessions. 0 is the most cost-saving value (brings the host pool down to zero session hosts)
- Temporarily rollout new session hosts up to a max. number of hosts in the pool:
  If a default rollout profile is configured, autoscale can create new session hosts if needed. This configuration limits the total amount of session hosts in the pool. Temporarily created session hosts will be removed automatically if no longer needed. Note: Power-On-Connect cannot trigger the creation of a new session host
- Concurrent starts/rollout of session hosts at the same time:
  Limits the number of parallel starts/creation of session hosts. In a huger environment, increase this value to start more session hosts at the same time



Additionally, you can configure schedules to have several session hosts running in the peak time of the logons (e.g. between 7:00 am and 9:00 am). Hint: You don't need to cover the working hours - if more session hosts are needed, autoscale will start or create new hosts (like an auto-pilot).



Add a new schedule and configure:

- Min. Hosts:
  The min. number of hosts running in the time frame. If fewer hosts are running, autoscale will start/create additional hosts
- Min. Free Sessions:
  Optionally: Minimum number of available (free) sessions during the schedule. The engine keeps care that enough session hosts are running to handle this number of new sessions (the engine will start additional hosts)
- Weekdays, from, to:
  The time when this schedule is active
- Load-Balancer: 
  You can change the load-balancer type for the time frame to breadth-first to spread the logons around all available session hosts. That increases the performance dramatically in a logon-storm-phase
- Build-First:
  If a default rollout profile is configured, you can use this option to temporarily roll out a new session host to reach the minimum level of hosts for this time frame. Temporarily created session hosts will be removed automatically if no longer needed. Note: This is a great option with Power-on-Connect: Let the engine create 60% of the needed hosts in the morning and left the existing host deallocated for Power-on-Connect
- Note: Configure the time zone of the host pool in the "Base" tab


**Pro-Tip:**

- Create a default rollout profile in the "New session host rollout" tab and test it 
- User Power-on-Connect to bring down the host pools to 0 hosts
- Have several session hosts deployed permanently to (with Hydra or WVDAdmin). These hosts are proposed to start them if new hosts are needed (starting is faster than creating)
- Use a schedule to provide temporarily created hosts in the rush hour (typically in the morning). These hosts will be deleted if no longer needed (and that saves the costs for the non-existing disks as well)
- Configure "Session Timeouts" to log off disconnected sessions


**Pro-Pro-Tip:** 

- Use ephemeral disks for more saving and higher performance)



**Example:**

![](media/Scale-Pooled-01.png)

#### Reserve a number of existing hosts
Reserve several existing hosts and prefer a rollout of temporary hosts if possible. The reserved hosts can be used by power-on-connect to start a host if the rollout is not fast enough. In this case, the users get the message that a new host is started (not an error message). The reserved hosts are also used if the limits for hosts in the pool are reached. Remember that disk-switching will not work for those hosts and that power-on-connect must be enabled on the host pool. Default: 0. Can be configured in Advanced Settings -> Details.



### Scaling of persistent host pools

A persistent host pool contains assigned session hosts for named users. A user can start the session hosts directly with the WVD client: If the session host is deallocated, a click to the desktop icon will start the session host using the [Power-on-Connect](https://blog.itprocloud.de/Custom-Role-for-Power-On-Connect-Preview/) feature.



To deallocate unused hosts automatically, configure "Autoscale & Autoshutdown" in Hydra:



***Dashboard -> Three dots icon (configuration) on the host pool -> Autoscale & Autoshutdown***



Add a new schedule and configure:

- Timeouts in minutes:
  The time after an unused session host will be deallocated
- Weekdays, from, to:
  The time when this schedule is active
- Note: Configure the time zone of the host pool in the "Base" tab



**Example:**

![](media/Scale-Persistent-01.png)

The example shutdown unused session hosts after 20 minutes for every day and time in a week.

Note: 

- You can add multiple schedules for different times
- Configure "Session Timeouts" to log off disconnected sessions
- Only session hosts without sessions are deallocated after the timeout



## Session timeouts

Session timeouts a very helpful to log off disconnected sessions fast. Disconnected sessions are log out automatically after a timeout. That is important to allow autoscale to deallocate session hosts. You can define different timeouts based on the weekdays and times (like in the example below):



***Dashboard -> Three dots icon (configuration) on the host pool -> Session Timeouts***



Add a new schedule and configure:

- Timeouts in minutes:
  The time after a disconnected session will be deallocated
- Weekdays, from, to:
  The time when this schedule is active
- Note: Configure the time zone of the host pool in the "Base" tab



**Example:**

![](media/SessionTimeouts-01.png)

For the example, disconnected sessions will be logged off:

- Mo-Fr between 7:00 am and 8:00 pm, after 120 minutes (working hours, enough time to have a lunch or a meeting)
- Mo-Fr outside 7:00 am and 8:00, after 20 minutes
- On the weekend, after 20 minutes

Note: 

- You can add multiple schedules for different times
- Session timeouts work for pooled and persistent host pools



## Delete FSLogix profiles from the user sessions menu

Users and administrators with the role ***User and profile manager*** or higher can delete FSLogix profiles in two ways:
- Select the users -> Burger menu ->Delete FSLogix Profile (left)

  - The users are logged off, and the FSLogix profile will be deleted from the storage

- Burger menu ->Delete FSLogix Profile (left)

  - Select a host pool and enter the user names (UPN, e.g., user1@contoso.com;user2@contoso.com) into the text field


In both cases, the profiles are deleted from the storage account. The profile path is read from one available session host in the host pool.

**Prerequisites:**

- Enter a service account of your local AD domain into the basic setting of each host pool where you want to use this feature. The service account is used to authenticate to the storage account, NetApp files, etc., and needs proper permission to delete files.
  - Hint: For Azure Files, give the service account *"Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor"* permission on the storage account. Note: That can take a while. I made progress after creating one folder on the share in the context of the service account.
- An available session host in the selected host pool

![](media/Delete-FSLogix-01.png)

## Scripts and Script Collections

Scripts and script collections. Both are intended to automize Azure VMs, and Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) from the management perspective.

### Script

A Powershell script for a session host. The script runs in the system context with system permissions, variables containing data about the host pool, session hosts, etc. Optionally, a Powershell credential object (PSC) can be used to connect to other services, like files shares (the service account can be configured on the host pool level).

![](media/Script-01.png)

### Script Collections

A script collection is a collection of scripts and tasks in any sequence. E.g.: Drain mode on -> Logoff users -> Start the VM -> Run a script -> Restart -> Drain mode off

![](media/ScriptCollection-01.png)

Additionally, parameters can be set for a script, and error handling is built-in. Script collections are very useful to orchestrate several tasks and scripts to session hosts.

### Built-in scripts and collections

There are several built-in scripts and collections, and new scripts and collections are provided continuously. Built-in scripts can be updated with the "Update" button in the upper-right corner.

![](media/ScriptCollectionSync-01.png)



To add a custom script or script collection, copy the *"BuiltIn: 1st Template Script"* or *"BuiltIn: 1st Template Script Collection"*. Then start building the new one. Make sure to save the new script/collection with a click of the disk symbol. There is no warning right now if you close the browser or if you navigate to another site.

![](media/ScriptCollectionSaveBar-01.png)



### Triggering a script or script collection

Scripts and script collections can be triggered by *Host pool administrators* and edited by *Full administrators*.

Both can be assigned/triggered in different ways:

#### For selected hosts

![](media/ScriptCollectionAssign-SessionHosts-01.png)

#### Automatically after the rollout of a new session host

![](media/ScriptCollectionAssign-Rollout-01.png)

#### By a schedule

Schedules can be used on a host pool level to run a script or collection unattended on session hosts of the pool. Comparable to other schedules, weekday(s) and start time define the plan. The following parameters can be used to fine-tune the schedule:

- Hosts

- - Run on all hosts
  - Run only on hosts without user sessions
  - Run only on hosts in drain-mode

- Simultaneously

- - Starts directly on all hosts
  - Start on max. 5 session hosts at the same time (if one finished, the script/collection will be started on the next host)
  - ...

![](media/ScriptCollectionAssign-Schedule-01.png)

This example runs Windows Update on all session hosts Sunday, 1:00 am. Including drain mode, start, update, restart, drain mode off.

### The Hydra Agent

The Hydra Agent is currently in preview and is needed for an optional feature set. Today, it's required to show user processes in the user session or in the session host list and maybe to terminate processes in case of an issue. Additionally, the agent is needed to show CPU, memory, CPU and disk queue length in the session host list.

How does it work: The Hydra Agent connects to the Hydra app service via secure WebSocket and a secret to allow real-time communication. The communication flow is from the Hydra instance to the agent: The Hydra instance asks for information (e.g., process list), and the agent responds with the requested data. The agent cannot trigger a function on the Hydra instance.

##### Precondition
WebSocket needs to be enabled on the Hydra app service in the Azure Portal as well: App Services -> Hydra Instance -> Configuration -> General Settings -> Web Sockets
- Open the app service of your Hydra instance in the Azure Portal
- Go to: Configuration -> General settings -> Set Web sockets to On
- Click "Save" (your Hydra instance will restart)

![](media/HydraAgent-02.png)

#### Installing the Hydra Agent on new hosts
Check the box 'Install Hydra Agent' in the 'New session host rollout' tab of the host pool configuration for new session hosts.

#### Deploy the agent to existing session hosts
- Create a new script collection by copying an existing one
- Change the name and description to "Install Hydra Agent"
- Clear the collection and add one step: "VM - Deploy Hydra Agent"
- Save the new collection

Hint: If your Hydra instance has another external name then myinstance.azurewebsites.net, you can set the external name as a parameter of the step in the collection

Open a host pool where you want to run the agent. 

- Select the hosts
- Click in the burger menu "Start a script or collection"
- Select "Install Hydra Agent" and click "Ok"

Hint: You can run "Install Hydra Agent" with the image creation process on the Golden Master. All deployed session hosts based on this master will have the Agent installed, and you can directly use the advanced features.

### AAD Only - Join and re-join hosts
Azure AD-only joined are getting more common in Azure Virtual Desktop. There are some challenges running AVD hosts as AAD-only. One challenge is that you can roll out a new session host in AAD only if a device with the same name doesn't exist. In the past, that was possible, but that may be changed over the last few months.

If you roll out a new session host with AAD-only integration and a device with the same exist, you get an error message:

***Another object with the same value for property hostnames already exists.***

So, if you roll out session hosts after an update of the image again and you try to reuse the names, you have to remove the older - no longer existing devices - from AAD first.

To make this a bit easier, I added two options to do this with Hydra for Azure Virtual Desktop in an automated way:

1) If you added the service principal Hydra used to the role *"Cloud Device Administrator"* and ticked the box "Azure Active Directory: Try to delete old device" in the rollout configuration, Hydra will delete existing devices with the same name from Azure AD. Note: "Cloud Device Administrator" is a highly privileged role. Alternatively, the 2nd option doesn't need this role.
2) Run a script shortly before deleting a session host to remove the device. Running dsregcmd.exe locally on a device will remove the device from AAD. To automate this, a script collection can be selected in the base settings of the host pool configuration: Run script or collection on specific events -> On-Delete -> Select the collection "BuiltIn: Remove device from Azure Active Directory before deleting host". The collection moves the host into the drain mode and runs the script shortly before the host is deleted. (Note: If the script collection is not visible, update the build-in scripts by clicking on the update button in the upper right corner of the script menu). The on-delete option can also be used for other aspects.

### Showing user processes
If the Hydra Agent is installed on session hosts, the processes of a single user can be shown in the "User sessions" menu. Click on the icon right to the user to show the processes.

### Database and Managed Service Identity
Hydra connects to the database with a SQL user defined in the connection string stored in the Key Vault. Alternatively, Hydra can connect using its Azure AD identity.

Do the following changes in the maintenance windows:
Open the SQL server resource in the Azure Portal -> Azure Active Directory  -> Set the managed identity of Hydra's web service as an administrator and check "Support only Azure Active Directory authentication for this server"

Change the connection string in the Key Vault. Open the Key Vault and give yourself permission (Access Policy) to change secrets. In secrets, copy the existing connection string from Hydra-DbConnectionString and modify it to match the following string:

Server=tcp:<my-database-server>.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=Hydra;Persist Security Info=False;Encrypt=True;Connection Timeout=90;

Remove the other parts of the string (like user id, ...). Add the new connection string as a new version. Optionally, remove your permission from the Key Vault.
Restart the app service and verify that the engine runs with the new configuration

### ADE

Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) encrypts the OS and data disks of Azure virtual machines (VMs) inside your VMs by using BitLocker. ADE cannot be combined with a disk encryption set.

To roll out session hosts with ADE, some resources must be prepared to work: Azure Key Vault with an encryption key, and Azure Key Vault to store the secrets of the disks (can be the same vault)

- First, create a Key Vault in the Azure Portal
- Give the service principal (from the tenant configuration) contributor permission to the vault (access and control)
- In Access Policies, give the service principal the following permissions:
-- Key permissions: Get, Encrypt, Wrap Key
-- Secret permissions: Set
- Check the boxes: Azure Virtual Machines for deployment and Azure Disk Encryption for volume encryption
- Give yourself permissions: Key and secret management
- Go to Keys and click on Generate. Type a name and select RSA and 2048
- Click on the generate key and on the current version. Copy the Key identifier (must include the version). E.g., https://avd-disks.vault.azure.net/keys/ADE-Encryption/bf270e977a574813a87bb637d57a6675

In Hydra, configure "New Session Host Rollout":
In "Advanced settings" select the Key Vault  in ADE Key Vault
Copy the Key Identifier to ADE Encryption Key Url

Hint: If you left the ADE Encryption Key Url empty, Hydra creates a new key for each session host. For this, the service principal needs additional key permissions: Update, create

Do a deployment to verify that the disk is ADE encrypted:

## External REST Calls
Hydra can accept REST-Calls to create new session hosts. To enable this feature, create a new secret in the Key Vault deployed with Hydra (you have to give yourself access to the secrets of the Key Vault first).
- Name: Hydra-RESTAccess
- Secret value: A complex (URL encoded) self-defined secret with at least 32 characters. Make this complex to secure access.

If the secret does not exist, is empty, or has less than 32 characters, Hydra will not accept REST Calls.

After creating or changing the secret, a restart of Hydra (the app service) is necessary. Do this only if no imaging or deployment is currently running. Hydra can be restarted using the avatar menu (upper-right corner) and select Restart Engine.

Authorization:
- Authorization: Using the Authorization header with the value "SharedKey <Secret Value>"

Accessible APIs:
- Creat a new host: /rest/hostpools/\<HostPool-Guid\>/addhostspartial
  - POST
    - The body can contain:
      - VmSize:	String; e.g. Standard_D8as_v5
      - AssigneUser:	String; e.g. user@domain.com (only for personal pools)
      - DiskSizeInGb: Number; Size of the OS disk
      - PoolGroup: string; custom, only valid if host pool Guid is Guid.Empty (must match one of the pool with the deployment tag "AVD.PoolGroup"
      - Other properties are used from the default deployment configuration of the host pool
  - Return:
    - A guid to query the state of the task
	
- State of the task
  - GET
  - Http return code: /rest/actions/\<task-guid\>
    - 200: Done successfully
    - 404: Not found
    - 202: Still running
    - 409: Failed

## Updating the client secret of the app service
During the rollout of Hydra, a service principal of the app service was created using the PowerShell script. The service principal is used by the web GUI to authenticate users and get the profile data, like the group membership. The secret of the service principal typically expires after one year and must be recreated. To do that, go into Azure AD -> App registrations -> All applications and select the used service principal (by default named "svc-HydraWebAuthentication". Generate a new client secret in "Certificates & secrets". Copy the new secret value into the clipboard and navigate to the deployed key vault (having the same name as the website of the Hydra portal). In the key vault, go to Secrets and update the secret "AzureAd--ClientSecret" with the copied secret. Restart the app service to use the updated secret.
